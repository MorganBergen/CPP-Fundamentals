<br>A stack is a data structure that retrieves items in the reverse of
the order in which they are stored.&nbsp; Suppose you have placed letters
'A', 'B', and 'C' in a stack.&nbsp; When you take these letters out of
the stack, they will be removed in the order 'C', then 'B', and at last
'A'.&nbsp; A good example of stack is the container that usually keeps
three tennis balls.&nbsp; The first ball can be retrieved from the container
was the last to be placed into the container.&nbsp; The ball at the bottom
of the container was the first to be placed into the container.&nbsp; So,
the one that was pushed last will pop first.
<p>There are two main operations associated with stacks; 1) putting things
on the stack which is referred to as <b>push</b>, and 2) taking things
from the stack which is referred to as <b>pop</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can create
a stack using linked lists if we force ourselves to insert and remove nodes
only at the top of the list.&nbsp; One use of a stack is when you want
to write a word backward.&nbsp; In that case, you will read the letters
of the word one-by-one and as you read them will push them onto a stack.&nbsp;
Once all letters are pushed onto the stack, then pop them back one-by-one.&nbsp;
This will produce the letters of the word in reverse order.

15.4</font></font></b>
<br>Use the previous two programs, to write a new program that implements
a stack.&nbsp; Your program will ask users to input a word letter-by-letter
and then displays the word backward.&nbsp; Please note that you are working
with letters to build the stack, thus when you read the word, you will
push the letters onto the stack and when you write them, you will pop those
letters one-by-one.
<p>Please note that a very detailed version of this program is shown in
Display 15.13 of the text book.&nbsp; In that program a stack class is
used for this purpose.
