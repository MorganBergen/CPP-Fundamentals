<br>Write a C++ program that displays in exact number the smallest and
the largest number of trees per square miles in a region.&nbsp; In order
to do this, you will ask the user to first input a number to tell the program
which one of the following combinations they will use for the two values
that they will enter, use choice:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when both the smallest and the largest numbers are integers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when the smallest number is an integer and the largest number is a float
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when the smallest number is a float and the largest number is an integer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when
both numbers are float
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other option is invalid,
display a message, and terminate the program.
<p>Here are the four scenarios you may face depending on the choice that
is made previously:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) If both numbers are integers, then you simply
call a function to display them as they were entered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) If the first number, the smallest number, was
entered with decimal point, you want to round the number down, then display
both values.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) If the second number, the largest number, was
entered with decimal point, you want to round that up, then display the
both values.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) If both the smallest and largest numbers were
entered with decimal, then you want to round the first one down and the
second one up, then display the values.
<p>You are required to use <u>function name overloading</u> to write 4
functions that take care of each one of the four scenarios.
