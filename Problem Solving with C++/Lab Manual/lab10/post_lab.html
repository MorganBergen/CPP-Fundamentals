<br>Write a C++ program that allows users to obtain some statistics on
an input image and to invert the image.
<p>Before you can write your program, you need to have some background
information on how an image is made.&nbsp; An image is made up of blocks
called pixels. Usually, when we refer to an image as an n by m (n*m) image,
we mean that there are n rows and m columns of pixels in that image. Thus,
n pixels in each column and m pixels on each row. That makes n*m pixels
all together.&nbsp; In a greyscale image, every pixel has a value between
0 to 255. The black color is represented with a pixel value of 0 and the
white color with a pixel value of 255.&nbsp; Different shades of grey are
made by selecting a number in the range 0 to 255, a pure grey is 127 (50%
black and 50% white).&nbsp; Following is an example of a 4x4 image (4 pixels
on each column and 4 on each row).&nbsp; <u>Please note that all pixels
are squares of the same size, some browsers may show the pixels on the
sample image in a different size, but in the actual image, all pixels appear
with the same size.</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=4 WIDTH="12%" >
<tr>
<td BGCOLOR="#000000">0</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#000000">0</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#666666">&nbsp;</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#000000">&nbsp;0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td BGCOLOR="#000000">0&nbsp;</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#999999">&nbsp;</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#333333">&nbsp;</td>

<td BGCOLOR="#000000">&nbsp;0</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>The pixel values on this 4x4 image are:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To generate this image simply create a file called <b>img1.ppm</b> and
type the following 8 lines iin it:
<br><font color="#990000">P3</font>
<br><font color="#990000"># This a sample 4x4 image</font>
<br><font color="#990000">4&nbsp; 4</font>
<br><font color="#990000">255</font>
<br>0&nbsp; 255&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 255
<br>255&nbsp; 127&nbsp; 255&nbsp; 0
<br>0&nbsp; 255&nbsp; 160&nbsp; 255
<br>255&nbsp; 86&nbsp; 255&nbsp; 0
<p>In this image, the first 4 lines define the format and characteristics
of the image, in brief:
<br><b><font color="#990000">P3</font></b>&nbsp; // Is the standard P3
PGM format
<br><font color="#990000"><b>#</b> This a sample 4x4 image</font>&nbsp;
// any comments
<br><b><font color="#990000">4&nbsp; 4</font></b>&nbsp; // number of rows
and columns
<br><b><font color="#990000">255</font></b>&nbsp; // maximum grey level
observed
<p>Once you saved the file then you can view it using an imaging software,
such as <i>xv</i>, Paint Shop Pro, or Adobe Photo Shop.&nbsp; Note that
since this image is very small, you may enlarge the view (zoom in) to see
the details.&nbsp; You also can use the imaging software to convert images
that are in other formats to pgm format.
<p>Your assignment is to read an image, to display some statistics on that
image, and to create its invert .&nbsp; The inverse of white color is black
and the inverse of a black color is white.&nbsp; So you need to convert
all the pixels of the 2-D array representing the image based on this scheme.
Your program must be flexible, thus correctly works for images of different
size.&nbsp; Here is a sample 8 by 8 image
<a href="samp_img.pgm.txt">samp_img.pgm</a>.
<p>Here is the list of functions you are required to use, but you are welcome
to use any additional functions.
<p><b>invert :</b> This function will take the array representing the image
and will invert its pixels. You basically use the following formula to
invert a single pixel:
<br>invert of x&nbsp; = |255 -x|. For example if a pixel on the original
image has the value of 255 after we invert it, it will become 0, a pixel
with pixel value of 80 will be converted to 255 – 80 = 175.
<p>The inverted image will be written into a new file, <b>img_invert.ppm</b>.&nbsp;
Please note that the first four lines of the input image must be written
into the inverted
<br>image without any change. So you need to copy these four lines from
the original image file to the inverted image.
<p><b>avrg_row:</b> This function will take the average of each row and
will write the result into the OutData file in the following format:
<br>Avg Row (1) :???
<br>Avg Row (2) :???
<p><b>avrg_column:</b> This function will take the average of each column
and will write the result into the OutData file in the following format:
<br>Avg Col (1) :???
<br>Avg Col (2) :???
<br>…..
<p><b>avrg_image: </b>This function will compute the average of the input
image and will write the result into the output file OutData.
<br>Avg Pixel: ???
<p><b>std_image: </b>This function computes the standard deviation of the
image based on the following formula:
<center>
<p><img SRC="imageQ57.JPG" height=97 width=189></center>

<p>in which <i>x<sub>i</sub> </i>is the individual pixel value, <i>x<sub>avg</sub></i>is
the mean (average) of all pixels, and N is the total number of pixels in
that image.
<p><b>distribution:</b> This function will compute and write the following
6 values into the output file OutData:
<p>Average + 1 STD: ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Average – 1 STD: ???
<br>Average + 2 STD: ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Average – 2 STD: ???
<br>Average + 3 STD: ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Average – 3 STD: ???
