<br>Answer the following questions in writing.
<p>1) In computing a number to the power of another such as x<sup>n</sup>,
you may use a procedure in which you use the number to the power of n-1
first then multiply it by x to get x<sup>n</sup>.&nbsp; Of course, then
you need to compute x<sup>n-1 </sup>.&nbsp; So you will follow the same
procedure until you get to the x<sup>0</sup>, which is actually equal to
1.&nbsp; Use this method to compute 4<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp; Show all the steps.

<p>2) Write a C++ code segment that takes a string and displays the characters
of that string one per line.&nbsp; Assume that the string is already read
in from the keyboard.
<p>Example:
<br>Input: Hello
<br>Output:
<br>H
<br>e
