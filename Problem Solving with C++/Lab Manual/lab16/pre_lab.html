<br>Answer the following questions in writing.
<p>1) In previous labs in several occasions you created an object of a
specific type using a class.&nbsp; For example after you created the class
Money, you created objects of type Money, m1 and m2 using:
<p>Money m1, m2;
<p>Doing this, both m1 and m2 would have all the variable members and member
functions of class Money.
<p>Suppose you want to create a new class that had all the variable members
and member functions of class Money, and you would also want to add other
functions or variable members to it.&nbsp; How would you do this?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2) Can you explain why we don't make all the member functions and variable
members of a function <i>private.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3) List some of the things you have learned, so far, about <i>Object
Oriented Programming (i.e. classes, objects, etc.).</i>
