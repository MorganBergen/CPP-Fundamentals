<b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>How does a computer solve a
problem?</font></font></b>
<p>Here is how you can imagine this better.&nbsp; Suppose you are an architect
who knows how to design a house&nbsp; and just got a job in Japan and wants
to build a house there.&nbsp; You don't know the Japanese language but
you have access to a translator.&nbsp; So, you write, on a piece of paper,
a set of instructions in English and will give that to the translator.&nbsp;
The translator will bring you a copy of your instructions in Japanese the
next day.&nbsp; This would happen if the translator would understand everything
that you have said.&nbsp; If there is something that wouldn't make sense
to him/her (syntax error), the translator would halt his/her job and would
let you know that there was something that must be fixed before he/she
could give you a correct final translation.&nbsp; The possible errors could
be caused by a set of syntactically incorrect instructions or could be
due to missing syntax.&nbsp; If you have no error, then you would have
a translation in your hand a bit later.&nbsp; When you look at the translated
instructions set, you don't understand it, after all it is written in a
different language. But don't be worried about this, there is someone who
can read these instructions and complete the house for you. The next thing
you need to do is to find a Japanese architect to build the house.&nbsp;
If you are lucky (for know we assume you are), the translator and the architect
may be the same person but you need to get the translation and resubmit
it to him/her for execution.&nbsp; The next thing that should happen is
that the Japanese architect will bring all the resources together and will
build the house for you.&nbsp; If all your measurements are correct and
all the requests are valid, you will get a good house. Sometimes you may
have made a request that is impossible to complete.&nbsp; An invalid request
may not necessary be due to a wrong syntax.&nbsp; For example, you have
asked the builder to build a dog house with height 0.&nbsp; Although that
dimension is a valid dimension on the paper, it is not practical.&nbsp;
So you may have asked the builder to build something that is not possible,
in which case he/she will let you know at the time that is executing the
instruction set (run-time error). A third type of error that may happen
is due to a mistake that you have made when you designed your algorithm
or when you were writing the set of instructions.&nbsp; For example, you
may have written "keep the distance between each steps at 1 foot" but you
meant to say "keep the distance between each steps at 1/2 foot". In that
case, the builder will build have the steps placed based on what he/she
sees on the instruction set.&nbsp; This kind of error is called logic error.&nbsp;
How many of them do you see in your daily life? Doors that get open on
the wrong side and steps that are too far apart or too close to each other.
<p>We can compare some of the characters and parts of this story to what
we will see in a programming class:
<p>You know how to design a house&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You know how to write a C++ program - syntax
<br>The set of instructions you write&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your C++ program
<br>The Japanese translator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The C++ compiler
<br>The translated version of your program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Executable file produced by the compiler
<br>The Japanese architect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Linker, input data,&nbsp; ....
<br>The house&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
