<br>In this course you will learn to write C++ programs to solve different
problems.&nbsp; From time-to-time this task may become frustrating and
difficult.&nbsp; However, with patience and practice, you will gain more
experience and things will get easier.&nbsp; The difficulty in using a
computer to solve problems comes from the fact that you need to somehow
ask a computer to do things for you.&nbsp; Imagine, sitting in front of
the computer and asking her to add two numbers,&nbsp; “Hey you add 2 to
4 and tell me what the answer is.”&nbsp; But we do not normally talk directly
to a computer, not yet. Instead, we communicate with it through an operating
system (OS).&nbsp; The communication with OS is done via the program that
you write.&nbsp; Our program is a set of instructions that a computer will
follow.&nbsp; These instructions are not in English but we understand them
very well, because they are written in a high-level language.&nbsp; These
instructions will, at some point, get to the machine much differently in
machine language.&nbsp; The machine language is a low-level language.&nbsp;

<p>In general, you will go through several steps before you can get an
output from your program;&nbsp; 1) First you will use an editor to type
your program, 2) then you will use a compiler (in our case a C++ compiler)
to compile your program and to get an executable file, and 3) at last,
you will run the executable file to obtain the output.
<p>The most important part of a programmer's job is solving the problem
first.&nbsp; It is much harder to solve a problem than to translate your
ideas to a specific programming language.&nbsp; Thus, one should first
think about a method and develop an algorithm to solve the problem.&nbsp;
An algorithm is a sequence of <u>precise</u> instructions, which results
in a solution.&nbsp; The keyword here is precision.&nbsp; If your algorithm
has ambiguity in it, then you will not get the correct answer.

<br>Suppose you are helping the university registrar office with the registration
process. You are to send students to six different halls depending on the
first letter of their last names and the balance that has appeared on their
bills.&nbsp; Here are the criteria you will use to separate them:
<br>Students with balance zero, Letters:
<br>A-E in Hall 3, F-J in Hall 2, L-O in Hall 8, P-R in Hall 10, and S-Z
in Hall 12.
<p>Students with a non-zero balance go to Hall 18. These students can go
back to register once they have a zero balance on their bills.
<p>Write (or draw a diagram) to show the steps that your algorithm will
take to solve this problem.&nbsp; Here are a few hints: <a href="hint1.jpg">hint1</a>,
