<br>Problem solving is usually broken into two major phases:
<br>1) Problem solving phase, and 2) Implementation phase.
<p><font color="#006600">Phase (1) - </font>In the first phase, you will
take three steps:
<br><b>Step I:</b> You will define the problem that you want to solve,
clearly.
<br><b>Step II:</b> You will design an algorithm that is precise and very
well thought to solve the problem, and
<br><b>Step III:</b> You will test your algorithm on paper.&nbsp; Your
algorithm should work correctly, before you can write a program for it.
<p><font color="#006600">Phase (2) -</font>In this phase, you will take
two steps:
<br><b>Step I: </b>Translate your algorithm to C++ language.&nbsp; If you
have a correct and precise algorithm, the translation should be almost
line-by-line.&nbsp; This translation must be correct and free of:
<ul>
<li>
A) Syntax errors, which are the errors resulted from incorrect use of the
programming language syntax or violation of syntax rules.</li>

<li>
B) Computations that are not possible, such as dividing by 0, and</li>

<li>
C) Errors made by the programmer.&nbsp; Such errors are those made by using
wrong signs or arithmetic operators.</li>
</ul>
<b>Step II: </b>Test the program to make sure it produces the correct results.&nbsp;
Make sure your test cases are different.&nbsp; The only way to correctly
test a program is to have many different test cases.
<p><b><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Preparing to Write a Simple C++
Program</font></font></b>
<br>Before you can write, compile, and run the first program, you need
to learn about several minor issues.
<p><b><font color="#009900">Issue 1: Operating Systems (OS)</font></b>
<br>Your C++ compiler usually runs on an OS. In this lab, we assume that
you will use a Unix or a Unix-like operating system.&nbsp; We have included
a <a href="unix_man.html">short manual for Unix</a> commands.&nbsp; This
short manual will give you a list of a very limited number of commands.&nbsp;
One can learn more by using other detailed manuals by referring to Unix
books and/or by reading the online Unix man pages by typing <i>man</i>
&lt;command name> at the command prompt.
<p><b><font color="#009900">Issue 2: Editors</font></b>
<br>Once you design your algorithm and test it on the paper, you need to
use a text editor to type the program.&nbsp; There are several editors
that you can use to type your program.&nbsp; The most common text editors
are vi, pico, and nedit.&nbsp; Your instructor may ask you to use one of
these three or may have another one in mind.&nbsp; We have included two
short manuals here; one <a href="vi_man.html">for vi</a> and the other
<a href="pico_man.html">for pico</a> that will help you with the basic
skills that you need to get your program off the ground.&nbsp; If you do
not know how to use an editor, we recommend that you get the short manuals
that we have provided here or those that your instructor provides to get
familiarized with the editor of your choice.
<p><b><font color="#009900">Issue 3: Compilers</font></b>
<br>Depending on the type of a machine that you will use, you may have
a different C++ compiler.&nbsp; GNU C++ compiler is a freeware compiler
that many people use. To compile a C++ code, the GNU C++ compiler requires
you to type g++ &lt;the program name>.&nbsp; If that command is different
on the machine that you are using from now-on instead of g++, use the command
that is applicable to your system.
<p><b><font color="#009900">Issue 4: Mail</font></b>
<br>Throughout the semester, you may need to communicate with the instructor,
your classmates, and/or the instructional assistant.&nbsp; There are several
e-mail packages on Unix that you can use. You need to find out what package
is used for e-mail purposes on the system that you will use for this course.
<p>Now we can go ahead and write the first program.
