<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>A grocery store sells many cases of soft drink everyday.&nbsp; In each
case, there are 12 bottles and the store profits 20 cents per bottle. We
want to compute the profit that the store has every day of selling soft
drink.&nbsp; We also want to know the profit for selling soft drink in
a year. Assume a year is 365 days.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>1) Problem Definition:</font></font></b>
<br>Compute the profit that a store has in one day for selling soft drink?
<br>Compute the profit that a store has in one year for selling soft drink?
<p>This program is so computationally extensive, that we want to write
a C++ program to solve it on a computer!&nbsp; At least we will assume
it is for now.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>2) Program Design - Algorithm</font></font></b>
<br>Before we attempt to write the program, let's develop an algorithm
for solving the problem.
<p><a NAME="ex12"></a><b><font color="#00CC00"><font size=+1>Exercise 1.2</font></font></b>
<br>Design the algorithm for this problem.&nbsp; On a piece of paper draw
a diagram or write in English the steps.&nbsp; Remember your algorithm
must be precise.&nbsp; Once you are done with your design, if you wish
you can compare your design with the one we have given <a href="algo.jpg">here</a>.
This algorithm must be translated to C++ to obtain the program.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>2-A) Desktop Testing</font></font></b>
<br>Now that you have the algorithm, test it to see if it works on paper.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>3) Implementing the Algorithm
in C++</font></font></b>
<br>This is where you will translate the algorithm to C++.&nbsp; Here is
a program that is designed based on the algorithm that is given in the
previous part.&nbsp; Check to make sure you find everything is translated
preciously.

<p><a NAME="ex13"></a><b><font color="#00CC00"><font size=+1>Exercise 1.3</font></font></b>
<br>Create the lab1 directory under the directory that you are using for
this course. Change to that directory.&nbsp; Open a blank file, P11.cpp,
and either cut and paste or carefully type the above program in that file,
save the file, and exit.&nbsp; Note that on some machines the C++ compiler
does not compile files with .cpp extension, so you may need to save the
file as P11.C.&nbsp; If you save your C++ programs with .C extension, then
replace .cpp extension with .C in the rest of programs given in all labs.&nbsp;
For now, we assume that you are saving your files with .cpp extension.
<p>Compile the program by typing:
<br>% g++ P11.cpp&nbsp; (or % g++ P11.C if you saved your files with .C
extension)
<p>If there is no syntax error in your program, you should get a new file
called a.out.&nbsp; To run the program type:
<p>% a.out
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>4) Test the Program</font></font></b>
<br>The last thing you need to do is to test the program to make sure it
produces the correct results.
<p>Assuming the store sells 10 cases per day, what would be the profit
per day and per year?&nbsp; You can confirm the answer by hand.
<p><a NAME="ex14"></a><b><font color="#00CC00"><font size=+1>Exercise 1.4</font></font></b>
<br>Modify program P11.cpp so that it uses 22 Cents profit per bottle in
the calculations.&nbsp; This time in your output, display both the number
of bottles sold and the profit for one day, one year, and 10 years.&nbsp;
Call your new program P12.cpp.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>What is what in the Simple C++
Program P11.cpp?</font></font></b>
<br>On the first line of the program you have:
<p><font color="#CC0000">// </font><font color="#3366FF">P11.cpp - This
C++ Program will compute the profit of selling soft drinks</font>
<p>The <font color="#CC0000">//</font> tells the compiler that the line
is only a comment and do not participate in the computing.&nbsp; Comments
are added for readability and/or to describe parts of a program.
<p>On the next line you have:
<br><font color="#3366FF">#include &lt;iostream></font>
<p>This is called an include directive.&nbsp; It tells the compile where
to find information about some of the items that are used in your program.
For example: cout, &lt;&lt;, >>, and cin in the above program.&nbsp; There
are other libraries that you will use to include other items.&nbsp; Note
that the directive always begin with #.
<p><font color="#3333FF">using namespace std;</font>
<p>This line will tell the compiler that the names defined in iostream
are to be interpreted in and “standard way”.&nbsp; Note that your program
should work without this, as your default set up is to use a global namespace.&nbsp;
We will discuss the namespace in more details in Lab 10.
<p><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;int main( )</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">{</font>
<p>Let’s just say that this marks the beginning of your main program.&nbsp;
Actually, int is used for type “integer”, main is a function name and (
) will mark the boundary of parameters.&nbsp; We promise that you will
learn about all this very soon.&nbsp; Note that the { marks the beginning
of the main function and } marks the end of it.&nbsp; In general, remember
that for every open {, you should have a corresponding }.
<p>In the next four lines:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#3366FF">int cases_per_day, bottles_per_day;</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int bottles_per_case
= 12,</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double profit_per_bottle
= 0.2;&nbsp; // 20 cents per bottle profit</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double profit_per_day, profit_per_year;</font>
<p>We will declare the variables that we plan to use and we also define
their type.&nbsp; We look at different variable types in the future labs.&nbsp;
In the above four lines int is used to declare variables of type “integer”.&nbsp;
On the second line we not only define the bottles_per_case as an integer,
we also initialized that to 12. On the 3rd and 4th lines, we have defined
variables of type double.&nbsp; Note that each instruction is ended with
a ;.
<p>On the following two lines:
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; “Press enter
after entering each number \n”;</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; “Enter number
of cases \n”;</font>
<br>we have used cout to display a message on the screen.&nbsp; The cout
statement will allow us to direct data from a variable out to the screen.
<p>On the other hand, in the following line the cin directs data from the
keyboard into a variable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#3366FF">cin >> cases_per_day;</font>
<p>It is important but very easy to remember what the direction of &lt;&lt;
and >> is.&nbsp; Note that when we send data to the screen, we send it
to cout so the direction must be &lt;&lt;, and when we send data from the
keyboard to a variable using cin the direction must be toward the variable
>>.
<p>In the sample program, we have perform some calculations:
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profit_per_day = cases_per_day
* bottles_per_case * profit_per_bottle;</font>
<br><font color="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profit_per_year = 365 * profit_per_day;</font>
<p>In the first line we have multiplied, *, cases_per_day by bottles_per_case
by profit_per_bottle, and stored the result, =, into profit_per_day.&nbsp;
We will learn about different arithmetic operators in future labs.&nbsp;
Explain what you have done in the second line.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Congratulations, in this lab, you learned about some the basic steps
you need to take to solve a problem using a computer program.&nbsp; Also,
you learned some of the syntax in C++.&nbsp; In the last part, we briefly
discuss the type of error you may run into when you write a computer program.
<p>Kinds of Program Errors
<br>When you use a program to solve a problem, you may have one of the
following three errors: 1) Syntax Error, 2) Logic Error, and 3) Run_time
Error.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>1) Syntax Error</font></font></b>
<br>Syntax error will be the result of violation of the syntax (the grammar
rules) of the programming language that you use.&nbsp; For instance, if
you forget to put ; at the end of a C++ instruction, your compiler will
not correctly compile and will display and error on the screen.&nbsp; To
see the type of error, you can remove one of the ; a try to compile the
program.&nbsp; Another example of this type of error is if you do not have
a paired open { and close } set of braces.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>2) Logic Error</font></font></b>
<br>The logic error will be the result of incorrect translation of your
algorithm when you were writing the program.&nbsp; This error will not
be detected by the computer and the only way to find it is to test the
program carefully after it is completed.&nbsp; For instance, if in the
following statement:
<p><font color="#3366FF">profit_per_day = cases_per_day </font><font color="#CC0000">*</font><font color="#3366FF">
bottles_per_case * profit_per_bottle; </font><font color="#993366">//correct</font>
<p>which is the correct statement for computing the profit_per_day, but
if by mistake, we use + instead of *, then we will have:
<br><font color="#3366FF">profit_per_day = cases_per_day</font> <font color="#CC0000">+</font><font color="#3366FF">bottles_per_case
* profit_per_bottle;&nbsp; </font><font color="#993366">//wrong</font>
<p>We will get an answer, but that answer is not correct.&nbsp; The error
is the result of the mistake in the translation of our algorithm. Instead
of * we have used +.
<p><b><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>3) Run_time Error</font></font></b>
<br>A run_time error is detected when we run a program.&nbsp; This type
of error are mostly related to numeric calculations.&nbsp; For example,
a computer cannot compute the square root of a negative number.
