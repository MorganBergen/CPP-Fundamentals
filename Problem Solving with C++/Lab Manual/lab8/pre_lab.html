<br>Answer the following questions in writing.
<br>1) How can a non-member function access a variable member of a class,
where:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) variable member is defined
as <i>public</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) variable member is defined
as <i>private</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2) Suppose we have a class called student that keeps the following information
for two student objects:
<p>student1:
<br>ID - 444444444
<br>Phone Number (3 pieces) - 828, 888, 8888
<br>Date of Birth (3 pieces) - 11, 21, 1985
<br>Overall GPA - 3.45
<br>First Letter of Last Name: T
<br>First Letter of First Name: R
<p>student2:
<br>ID - 555555555
<br>Phone Number (3 pieces) - 828, 777, 7777
<br>Date of Birth (3 pieces) - 9, 2, 1965
<br>Overall GPA - 3.05
<br>First Letter of Last Name: S
<br>First Letter of First Name: G
<p>How would you check to see whether these two students are the same,
i.e., all information is exactly the same?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As you have noticed, assigning such values to many students without
packing all of this information into one variable is a very difficult task.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2) Write the program segment that determines which one of these two
students is younger.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3) Write the program segment to determine whether these students have
the same area code.
