<br>Write a C++ program that conducts the rational number operations.&nbsp;
Your program will use a rational number class to perform the <i>addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division </i>operations<i> </i>on two
fractions.&nbsp; You are required to write this class as part of this assignment.&nbsp;
For now, assume that the user will enter the numerator and the denominator
of the first fraction, followed by those for the second fraction.
<p>You need to use constructors for:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) correctly initializing variable members, and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) creating objects with given initial values.&nbsp;
Note that a fraction may have both a numerator and a denominator, for example:
(8/3), or may simply be a number, for example: 6, in which case you will
actually use (6/1) to represent it.&nbsp; Thus, the constructors with two
and one arguments should be included in the class definition.
<p>Your class will have a function for each one of the four operations.&nbsp;
For example: Suppose we have defined objects a and b as two fractions,
then to compute a + b, we will use:
<p>a.add(b);
<p>When you conduct an operation, you do not have to simplify the result,
i.e., 4/5 * 5/10 = 20/50.
<p>Here are some of the rules you may need:
<br>a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c) / (b*d)
<br>a/b - c/d = (a*d - b*c) / (b*d)
<br>(a/b) * (c/d) = (a*c) / (b*d)
<br>(a/b) / (c/d) = (a*d) * (c*b)
<p><i>A more complicated version of this program is listed at the end of
Chapter (6) - Problem 9.</i>
