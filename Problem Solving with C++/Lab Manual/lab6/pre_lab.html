<br>Answer the following questions in writing.
<p>1) Suppose we want to keep the following information for each student
in the department:
<p>ID - long integer
<br>Phone Number - 3 pieces (area code (integer), prefix (integer), and
suffix (integer))
<br>Date of Birth - 3 pieces (month (integer), day (integer), and year
(integer) )
<br>Overall GPA - float
<br>First Letter of Last name - char
<br>First Letter of First Name - char
<p>Assuming we don't know about structures and classes, how do you assign
these values to student1?&nbsp; Write the program segment that declares
the required variables, then assign the following values to student1:
<p>ID - 444444444
<br>Phone Number (3 pieces) - 828, 888, 8888
<br>Date of Birth (3 pieces) - 11, 21, 1985
<br>Overall GPA - 3.45
<br>First Letter of Last Name: T
<br>First Letter of First Name: R
<p>How do you assign the values to student1 and student2 in the same program?&nbsp;
Write the program segment that declares the required variables, then assign
the values to student1 and student2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the information
on student2:
<p>ID - 555555555
<br>Phone Number (3 pieces) - 828, 777, 7777
<br>Date of Birth (3 pieces) - 9, 2, 1965
<br>Overall GPA - 3.05
<br>First Letter of Last Name: S
<br>First Letter of First Name: G
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As you have noticed, assigning such values to many students without
packing all of this information into one variable is a very difficult task.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2) Write the program segment that determines which one of these two
students is younger.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3) Write the program segment to determine whether these students have
the same area code.
