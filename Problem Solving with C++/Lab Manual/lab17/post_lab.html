<br>1) Write a program that converts from 24-hour time to 12-hour time.&nbsp;
The following is a sample dialogue:
<p>Enter time in 24-hour notation:
<br>13:07
<br>That is the same as:
<br>1:07 PM
<p>Do you want to try a new case? (y/n)
<br>y
<br>Enter time in 24-hour notation:
<br>10:15
<br>That is the same as:
<br>10:15 AM
<br>Do you want to try a new case? (y/n)
<br>y
<br>Enter time in 24-hour notation:
<br>10:65
<br>There is no such a time as 10:65
<br>Enter another time:
<br>Enter time in 24-hour notation:
<br>16:05
<br>That is the same as:
<br>4:05 PM
<br>Do you want to try a new case? (y/n)
<br>n
<p>End of program.
<p>You will define an exception class called <i>TimeFormatMistake</i>.&nbsp;
If the user enters an illegal time, like 10:65 or even gibberish like 8&amp;*65,
then your program will throw and catch a <i>TimeFormatMistake.</i>
