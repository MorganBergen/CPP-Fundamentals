<br>Answer the following questions in writing.
<p>1) Suppose you are writing a program that performs many different arithmetic
operations.&nbsp; Some of these operations are not defined in some specific
situations.&nbsp; For example, division by zero and taking the square root
of a negative value are two operations that are not defined.&nbsp; Which
one of these two methods would you prefer:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) write the program to
perform the basics and once done, add the part that takes care of special
situations, or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) write the program and
as you write it include the specific situations.
<p>Explain why your choice is better than the other.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2) Write a program that asks users to input a number and then displays
the square root of that number.&nbsp; Create a function that displays a
warning message when you attempt to take the square root of a negative
value.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3) Suppose you are writing a program that at some point performs division.&nbsp;
How would you handle cases where you may divide by 0?
