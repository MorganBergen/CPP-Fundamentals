// My first C++ program!

#include <iostream>

int main()

     std::cout << "Hello World! " << 42 << '\n';

     return 0;

/*
 * The only note I want to leave on this file is that you may see the line
 * 
 * using namespace std;
 * 
 * created by your editor, or online. Do NOT use it. It's a terrible practice.
 * While it may not cause issues for small programs like we'll be writing,
 * experience has shown me that using it now just creates a bad habit that can
 * be tough to break in later courses when it will matter.
